Privacy Policy

Data Controller: The controller of your personal data is Metropolitan Food Group sp. z o.o., registered in Poland at ul. Aleja Krakowska 44, 05-090 Janki, Warsaw. This is a limited liability company listed in the National Court Register (KRS) under number 0000317933, with tax ID (NIP) 7292645203
krs-pobierz.pl
. We are committed to protecting your privacy in compliance with applicable laws, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

Scope of this Policy: This Privacy Policy applies to the "Metropolitan" mobile application, which facilitates the sale of Turkish food products in Poland. It explains what personal data we collect through the app, for what purposes we use it, and with whom we may share it. By using our app, you acknowledge and agree to the practices described below.

Types of Data Collected:

Information You Provide: When you register an account or place an order via the app, we collect the personal information you provide, such as your name, delivery address, email address, phone number, and any other details required for registration or checkout (e.g. billing address if different). Providing this information is voluntary, but it is necessary to enter into a sales contract and fulfill your order – if you do not provide required data, we will be unable to process your purchase
streetwear.com.pl
.

Order and Transaction Data: Details of the orders you place (e.g. list of purchased items, order date and number, chosen payment method, transaction amount) and your purchase history. We use this data to fulfill your orders and maintain proper records for accounting and customer service.

Technical and Usage Data: We may collect certain technical information automatically when you use the app, including your device’s IP address, device and browser type, language settings, and usage data (such as features used and pages viewed within the app). In particular, our integrated Stripe payment system may track device and browser details (like IP address and language preferences) and user activity via Stripe’s SDK in order to help detect fraud and ensure transaction security
usercentrics.com
. This information helps us improve the app’s performance, security, and user experience.

Payment Information: If you make a payment through Stripe in our app, the data necessary to process the payment (such as the cardholder’s name, email, billing address, payment amount and method) will be transmitted to Stripe and processed by them
winesign.io
. Note: We do not collect or store your full credit card details ourselves – payment transactions are handled securely by the external payment processor (Stripe).

Customer Support Communications: If you contact us with an inquiry or support request (via email or through the app), we may keep a record of that correspondence and any contact information you provided, so that we can respond to you and improve our services.

Purposes and Legal Bases for Processing:
We process personal data collected from you only for specific purposes and only where we have a legal basis under GDPR to do so. These purposes and bases include:

Order Fulfillment and Contract: To process and fulfill your orders for products, arrange delivery, and facilitate payments. This is necessary for the performance of the sales contract between you and us (GDPR Article 6(1)(b)).

Billing and Legal Compliance: To issue purchase receipts or VAT invoices and to comply with our legal obligations related to accounting, taxation, and consumer protection. The legal basis for such processing is our compliance with a legal obligation (GDPR Article 6(1)(c)). For example, we may use an invoicing service (Fakturownia) to generate and store invoices containing your name, address, and tax ID, as required by law
streetwear.com.pl
. Fakturownia processes customer data solely as a data processor on our behalf, under a data processing agreement and in compliance with GDPR
streetwear.com.pl
.

Payment Processing: To enable you to pay for orders electronically via our payment provider (Stripe). For this purpose, we transmit the necessary payment details to Stripe to authorize and complete the transaction
winesign.io
. The legal basis for sharing data with Stripe is that it is necessary to perform the contract (Article 6(1)(b)) and our legitimate interest in providing a secure and efficient payment solution (Article 6(1)(f))
contentpass.net
. Stripe may also use the data for fraud prevention and to fulfill its own legal obligations (e.g. anti-money laundering regulations).

Product Delivery: To deliver your purchased products to your specified address, we work with external courier/delivery services. We will use and share your contact information and address for the purpose of delivering the goods (performance of the contract, Article 6(1)(b)).

Customer Service and Communications: To communicate with you about your orders (e.g. order confirmations, updates, delivery notifications), respond to your inquiries, and handle complaints or returns. Depending on the context, the legal basis is either contract necessity (for communications about fulfilling an order) or our legitimate interest in ensuring quality customer service and support (Article 6(1)(f)).

Direct Marketing (with consent): If you have given us your consent, we may use your email address to send you our newsletter or promotional offers about new products or discounts. You can withdraw your consent at any time, which will prevent future marketing emails (with no effect on the lawfulness of processing prior to withdrawal).

Analytics and Improvements (legitimate interest): We may use technical and usage data to analyze how the app is used, to troubleshoot performance issues, and to develop new features or improve existing ones. We rely on our legitimate interest in analyzing and improving our services (Article 6(1)(f) GDPR) – in doing so, we typically use aggregated or anonymized data that does not identify individual users.

Sharing of Data with Third Parties:
We treat your personal data as confidential and do not sell it to third parties. However, we do share data with certain trusted third parties when it is necessary to achieve the purposes described above, or when we are legally required to do so. The main categories of recipients include:

Payment Processor (Stripe): When you make an online payment in the app, the payment details are forwarded to Stripe. Stripe processes these data as an independent data controller for the purpose of completing the payment, under its own privacy policy. Stripe is a global company; therefore, your payment data may be processed on servers outside the European Economic Area (for example, in the USA). Stripe has safeguards in place for international data transfers, including participation in the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework
winesign.io
. We hereby inform you (as required by Stripe’s policies) that we share your personal data with Stripe for payment processing
usercentrics.com
.

Invoicing Service (Fakturownia): If we issue an invoice for your order, we will input the necessary personal data (name, address, tax ID if applicable) into the Fakturownia invoicing system, operated by Fakturownia sp. z o.o. Fakturownia acts as our data processor and uses the data only to properly issue, send and archive the sales documents
streetwear.com.pl
, according to our agreement with them and GDPR requirements.

Delivery Companies: For order fulfillment, we share your delivery address and contact phone number with the courier or postal service responsible for delivering your package. They are authorized to use this information only for delivery purposes.

IT/Hosting Providers: We use reputable third-party providers for application hosting, data storage (cloud services), and related IT support. These providers may incidentally have access to personal data in the course of maintenance or backup operations, but they process data only on our instruction (as processors) and are bound by strict confidentiality and data protection obligations.

Legal Authorities: We will disclose personal data to government or law enforcement authorities if required to do so by law – for example, in response to a court order, subpoena, or other legal process, or to meet statutory reporting obligations.

All third parties that process personal data on our behalf are bound by data processing agreements and must implement appropriate data protection and security measures. They can only use your data within the scope of the purposes we specify. We do not permit any third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own marketing purposes.

Data Retention:
We retain personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, or to comply with applicable legal requirements. Specifically:

Account Data: If you have an account, your profile information is stored as long as your account is active. If you delete your account, we will remove or anonymize your personal data from our active systems (unless we need to retain certain information to comply with laws or resolve disputes). Backup copies might persist temporarily but will be purged according to our data retention cycle.

Order and Transaction Data: Records of purchases, invoices, and payments are retained for the period required by law. In Poland, financial records (e.g. invoices) must be kept for 5 years for tax and accounting purposes.

Marketing Data: If we process personal data based on your consent (e.g. email address for newsletter), we keep it until you withdraw consent. If you unsubscribe from marketing communications, we will stop using your data for that purpose and remove it from our marketing list.

Logs and Analytics: Technical logs and usage data are generally retained for troubleshooting and analytics for up to 12 months in an identifiable form. Aggregated, anonymized analytics (which contain no personal data) may be kept longer for historical analysis.

After the applicable retention period, we will securely erase or irreversibly anonymize personal data. In some cases, data may persist in secure backups for a short additional period, but we will not use it for any active purpose after the retention period expires.

Your Rights:
Under GDPR and relevant data protection laws, you have a number of rights regarding your personal data. These include:

Right to Access: You have the right to ask us whether we are processing your personal data, and if so, to receive a copy of the data along with information about how we use it
visunext.pl
.

Right to Rectification: You can request that we correct any inaccurate or incomplete personal data about you. We encourage you to keep your account information up-to-date.

Right to Erasure: You can, in certain circumstances, request that we delete your personal data (for example, if it is no longer needed for the purposes it was collected, or if you withdraw consent and we have no other legal basis for processing). This is not an absolute right – for instance, we might need to retain some data to comply with a legal obligation.

Right to Restrict Processing: You can ask us to restrict (pause) the processing of your personal data in certain cases – for example, while we are verifying the accuracy of your data or when you have objected to our processing and we are considering whether our legitimate grounds override yours.

Right to Data Portability: For data that you have provided to us and which we process by automated means under consent or contract, you have the right to request a copy in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. You also have the right to request that we transfer this data to another controller, where technically feasible.

Right to Object: You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data when we process it based on legitimate interests, on grounds relating to your particular situation. If you object, we will consider whether our compelling legitimate grounds for processing override your interests, rights, and freedoms. Note: If your data is processed for direct marketing purposes, you have the right to object at any time and we will stop processing for that purpose immediately.

Right to Withdraw Consent: If we rely on your consent for any processing of personal data, you can withdraw that consent at any time. This will not affect the lawfulness of processing that happened prior to withdrawal, but it will mean we can no longer process the data in question going forward.

Right to Lodge a Complaint: If you believe we have infringed your data protection rights, you have the right to file a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the EU country of your habitual residence or where the alleged infringement occurred. In Poland, the supervisory authority is the President of the Personal Data Protection Office (Prezes UODO).

You may exercise your rights by contacting us using the contact information provided below. We will respond as soon as possible, and no later than one month after receiving your request (this period may be extended by two further months if necessary, depending on the complexity and number of requests, but we will inform you if an extension is needed).

Children’s Privacy:
Our app and services are not directed to children under 18 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal data from anyone under 18. If you are under 18, you should use the app only with the involvement and consent of a parent or legal guardian. Should we discover that we have unintentionally collected personal information from a minor without proper consent, we will delete that information promptly.

Data Security:
We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational measures to secure your personal data and protect it against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. For example, all network communications involving personal data (including payment information) are encrypted using SSL/TLS protocols. We restrict access to personal data to authorized personnel and contractors who need that data to operate, develop, or improve our services, and these individuals are subject to confidentiality obligations. We also maintain procedures to handle any suspected data breaches, and in the unlikely event of a data breach affecting your personal information, we will notify you and the relevant authorities as required by law.

Contact Information:
If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or your personal data, or if you wish to exercise any of your rights, please contact us:

Email: info@metropolitanfg.pl

Changes to this Privacy Policy:
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our services or to comply with new legal requirements. If the changes are significant, we will notify users in advance by posting an in-app notification or sending an email to registered users, as appropriate. We encourage you to review this Policy periodically to stay informed about how we are protecting your information. The date of the latest revision will be indicated below. Continued use of the app after any changes to the Policy constitutes your acceptance of those changes.

Last updated: [Month Day, Year].

Terms of Service

General Provisions:

These Terms of Service (hereinafter “Terms”) govern the use of the "Metropolitan" mobile application (the “App”) provided by Metropolitan Food Group sp. z o.o., a limited liability company based in Warsaw, Poland (registered address: ul. Leonidasa 57/paw.502, 02-239 Warsaw, Poland). Metropolitan Food Group sp. z o.o. is registered in the National Court Register (KRS) under number 0000317933, NIP (tax ID) 7292645203
krs-pobierz.pl
, with share capital of 173,000 PLN. The company, referred to as the “Seller”, sells food products (specifically Turkish food items) to consumers in Poland via this App.

These Terms are made available to all Users free of charge via the App (and on the website www.metropolitanfg.pl, if applicable) in a form that allows them to be downloaded, saved, and printed. This document constitutes the regulations for the provision of electronic services as required by Article 8 of the Polish Act of 18 July 2002 on Providing Services by Electronic Means
frac.pl
.

By installing or using the App, including registering an account or placing an order, the person using the App (the “User”) agrees to abide by these Terms. If you do not agree with any part of the Terms, please refrain from using the App.

To use the App, the User must have a compatible mobile device with Internet access and a current operating system. The App is free to download and use; however, the User is responsible for any data charges incurred (per the User’s mobile network plan) and for paying the price of any products purchased through the App.

Definitions:

Seller – Metropolitan Food Group sp. z o.o., ul. Leonidasa 57/paw.502, 02-239 Warsaw, Poland, KRS 0000317933, NIP 7292645203. In these Terms, the Seller is also referred to as “we” or “us”. The Seller is the provider of the App and the party that sells Products to Users.

User – any natural person who has full legal capacity and uses the App to browse and purchase Products as a consumer (for purposes unrelated to their trade, business, or profession)
frac.pl
. If a person is under 18 years old or otherwise does not have full legal capacity (e.g., minors over 13 with limited capacity), they may use the App and make purchases only with the consent and supervision of a parent or legal guardian.

Products – tangible goods available for sale through the App, primarily Turkish food products and groceries. Each Product is described in the App with details such as name, price, ingredients (if applicable), and other relevant information.

Order – an instruction submitted by the User via the App’s ordering interface, indicating the User’s intent to purchase selected Products from the Seller under the conditions specified at checkout and in these Terms. An Order includes details like the chosen items and quantities, delivery address, and payment method.

Account – a personal user account within the App, created upon registration, which stores the User’s profile information (name, contact details, etc.) and records of orders placed. The Account is protected by login credentials (email address and password).

Terms – this Terms of Service document, governing both the use of the App and the sales of Products via the App.

Account Registration:

Registration of an Account in the App is recommended for a better shopping experience and may be required to place orders. To register, the User must complete the sign-up form in the App, providing information such as name, email address, and a password. The User must ensure that the information provided is accurate and current.

Account creation is voluntary and free of charge. A single User should register only one Account. The Account is non-transferable.

The User is responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of their Account login credentials. The User should not share their password with anyone. Any activity conducted through the Account will be presumed to be authorized by the User. If the User suspects any unauthorized use of their Account, they should notify the Seller immediately so that appropriate measures can be taken (e.g., password reset or account suspension).

The User can delete their Account at any time by contacting the Seller (for example, via email) or using any account deletion function provided within the App. Deleting the Account will result in termination of the contract for electronic services related to the Account (subject to data retention required for legal compliance as described in the Privacy Policy). The User’s right to use the App (as a guest or by creating a new account later) remains unaffected by deleting an Account.

Placing Orders:

Through the App, the Seller enables Users to place orders for available Products at any time (24 hours a day, 7 days a week). Orders placed outside of normal working hours will be processed on the next business day.

To place an Order, the User selects a Product and adds it to the virtual shopping cart. The User can adjust quantities or remove items from the cart before proceeding. When ready, the User proceeds to checkout, where the App will prompt for necessary information: delivery details (recipient name, address, phone number), email address (for order confirmation and communication), and payment method. If the User requires an invoice for a business purchase, they should provide the company name, registered address, and tax ID during checkout.

Before final submission, the User is presented with an order summary detailing the Products to be purchased, their individual prices, any applicable taxes, delivery cost, and the total amount payable. The User should carefully review this information and correct any errors (e.g., in the delivery address or product quantities) before confirming the Order.

To finalize the Order, the User must confirm the summary and select the option to place the order with an obligation to pay (the wording may be a button like “Order and Pay”). By doing so, the User makes a binding offer to buy the Products listed in the order summary, under the conditions stated in these Terms.

Upon receiving an Order, the Seller will acknowledge it by sending an order confirmation to the User (typically via email, and/or an in-app notification). This confirmation will summarize the Order details and assign an order number. The moment the User receives the confirmation (or, at latest, when we commence fulfillment of the order) a sales contract is formed between the User and the Seller for the Products specified.

If for any reason we are unable to accept or fulfill an Order (for example, if a Product is out of stock or if the provided delivery address is outside our service area), we will inform the User as soon as possible. If payment was already made for such an Order (or part of it), the User will be refunded for the unavailable items. Partial fulfillment (shipping available items and refunding the rest) may occur with the User’s consent; otherwise, the Order may be cancelled in full with a full refund.

The Seller reserves the right to verify Orders in cases of doubt (for instance, unusually large orders or potential errors). We may contact the User via email or phone to confirm order details or to clarify information before processing.

Prices and Payment:

Product Prices: All prices displayed in the App are in Polish Złoty (PLN) and are gross prices including VAT. The price shown for a Product at the time of Order placement is the price that will be charged. If a price was obviously misstated due to an error and was significantly low or high, the Seller will contact the User to inform about the mistake and may cancel the Order if the User does not agree to the correct price.

Payment Timing: Unless otherwise agreed, all Orders must be paid for at the time of ordering (prepayment). We do not offer “cash on delivery” or post-payment by default. Ownership of the goods will transfer to the User only after full payment of the purchase price.

Payment Methods: The following forms of payment are accepted for purchases made via the App:

Online payment by credit/debit card or quick bank transfer – these are processed through the Stripe payment system. When this method is selected, the User will securely submit payment details through Stripe’s interface integrated in our App. Stripe Payments Europe (Stripe’s EU affiliate) is the entity processing the payment in the EU
winesign.io
. The User must follow the on-screen instructions to complete the payment. Upon successful payment, the Order will move to processing.
(If we support other payment methods, such as mobile payments or bank transfer, they would be listed here with instructions.)
Note: The Seller does not collect or store sensitive payment data like full card numbers or bank credentials; such information is handled by Stripe on secure servers.

Payment Issues: If the payment fails or is not completed (e.g., due to card authorization failure or technical issues), the Order will not be accepted or processed. The User may attempt to place the Order again using a different payment method. The Seller is not liable for delays in processing or non-fulfillment of an Order if the failure to pay is due to the User’s action or omission or issues on the side of the payment provider.

Invoices: For each completed purchase, the Seller will issue either a fiscal receipt or a VAT invoice. By default, consumers receive a receipt. If the User needs an invoice (e.g., for a business purchase or personal records), they should provide the necessary billing details at the time of Order (company name, address, VAT ID if applicable). The invoice may be sent electronically to the User’s email address, unless a paper invoice is requested.

All payments are handled in compliance with data security standards. Our payment processor (Stripe) is PCI-DSS compliant, and all communication is encrypted. In case of any overcharge or duplicate charge, please contact us for prompt resolution.

Delivery:

Geographic Scope: The Seller currently ships Products only within Poland. Orders with delivery addresses outside Poland cannot be processed.

Delivery Address: Products will be delivered to the address specified by the User when placing the Order. It is the User’s responsibility to provide a correct, complete, and reachable address. We are not liable for delays or non-delivery if the address provided was incorrect or incomplete.

Delivery Methods and Costs: Available delivery methods (courier, postal service, parcel locker, etc.) and the associated shipping fees are presented to the User at checkout. The delivery cost depends on factors such as order size, weight, and selected carrier. Any applicable shipping promotions (e.g., free delivery for orders over a certain amount) will be automatically applied according to current terms.

Delivery Time: We aim to dispatch orders promptly. The estimated delivery time within Poland is usually 2–5 business days from the date of order confirmation. Please note that this is an estimate and not a guaranteed delivery window. During high-demand periods (like holidays or promotions) or due to unforeseen circumstances (e.g., weather events, courier delays), delivery might take longer. We will inform you if we become aware of any significant delay.

Order Tracking: Whenever possible, we will provide a tracking number or link so that the User can monitor the shipment status. This information will typically be sent in the shipping confirmation email or made available in the User’s Account under order details.

Receipt of Goods: Upon delivery, the User (or an authorized recipient at the address) should inspect the package for any visible damage. If the package appears damaged or tampered with, the User should, if possible, note this with the courier (e.g., by filling a damage report) and contact us promptly. While we ensure proper packaging, any damage in transit will be handled in accordance with the complaints procedure (see Complaints section below).

Failed Delivery: If a package cannot be delivered due to the User’s absence or other reason and is returned to us, we will contact the User to arrange a re-delivery. Additional delivery charges may apply for the second attempt, unless the failure was due to our or the carrier’s fault. If we cannot reach the User for re-delivery arrangements or the User declines re-delivery, we may treat the contract as terminated and process a refund for the order minus reasonable costs of delivery and return.

Right of Withdrawal (Consumer Returns):
The provisions in this section apply only if you are a consumer (an individual making a purchase for personal use, not related to business activities) and only to the extent not excluded by law (see exceptions below).

14-Day Return Period: As a consumer, you have the right to withdraw from the sales contract without giving any reason within 14 days after you or a person you designate (other than the carrier) receives the Product
visunext.pl
. If your order consisted of multiple items delivered separately, the 14-day period starts from receipt of the last item.

How to Withdraw: To exercise the right of withdrawal, you must inform us of your decision before the 14-day period has expired. You may do this by sending a clear statement (e.g., an email or a letter sent by post) to our contact address provided in these Terms. You may use the model withdrawal form that we can provide, but it is not obligatory. For your convenience, you can simply state your name, order number, and your intention to withdraw from the contract.

Effects of Withdrawal: If you withdraw from the contract, we will treat the purchase as canceled. We will refund all payments we received from you for the returned product, including the cost of the cheapest standard delivery offered for your order (if a delivery fee was charged). The refund will be made without undue delay, and in any event no later than 14 days from the day we receive your withdrawal notice. However, we may withhold reimbursement until we have received the returned product back or you have supplied evidence of having sent back the product, whichever occurs first.

Refund Method: We will refund you using the same payment method you used for the initial transaction, unless you explicitly agree to a different method that does not incur any fees for you. For example, if you paid by card, we will refund to the same card; if you paid via bank transfer, we will ask for your bank details for the refund.

Return of Goods: You are expected to send back or hand over the product(s) to us no later than 14 days from the day on which you communicate your withdrawal. You will bear the direct cost of returning the goods (shipping costs for the return) unless we have agreed otherwise. We recommend that you pack the item securely and, if possible, use the original packaging. Please include either a copy of the receipt or a note with your order number to help us identify the return.

Condition of Returned Goods: You should handle the products you ordered with care. You are allowed to inspect the nature, characteristics, and functioning of the item as you would in a physical store, but if you use the product beyond that (e.g., actually using food items or consuming part of them), and as a result the product’s value is diminished, we may deduct compensation for the loss in value from your refund.

Exceptions (No Right of Withdrawal): Certain products are not eligible for the 14-day return right, by law. The right of withdrawal does not apply to, among others
prawakonsumenta.uokik.gov.pl
:

Goods that are liable to deteriorate or expire rapidly (e.g., fresh food products, items with a short shelf life).

Sealed goods which are not suitable for return due to health protection or hygiene reasons, if unsealed after delivery (this includes sealed food products that cannot be resold once the seal is broken, etc.).

Goods made to your specifications or clearly personalized.

Sealed audio or video recordings or computer software which were unsealed after delivery.

Newspapers, periodicals or magazines (except for subscription contracts).
If a product you purchased falls under these exceptions, we will have informed you of this in the product description or at checkout, and you agree that no return can be accepted for those particular items.

Return Address: Unless we provide a different return address when you contact us, you should send returned products to our company’s registered address (see Contact Information below). We advise using a tracked shipping method and keeping proof of return shipment.

Customer Support: If you have any questions about the return process, you can contact us at our customer service email or phone number for assistance.

Complaints and Warranty:

Statutory Warranty: We are obliged to deliver products that conform to the contract of sale. This means the products should match their description, be of satisfactory quality, and be fit for normal use. If a product you purchased is defective (e.g., it is damaged, spoiled, or does not match its description or intended use), you have the right to file a complaint. This right is based on the statutory warranty for defects (in Polish law: rękojmia).

How to File a Complaint: You should inform us if you find any issues with the product. You can send a complaint via email or letter. Please include your name, order number, the product in question, and a description of the problem. If possible, attach photos if it’s a physical defect or damage, as this can help us resolve the issue more quickly.

Timeline: We will acknowledge and respond to your complaint within 14 days of receiving it. If we do not respond within this 14-day period, the law deems that we have accepted the complaint and acknowledge the defect.

Resolution: Depending on the nature of the defect and your request, the possible resolutions under warranty are:

Repair: If the item can be fixed, you may request a repair. We will repair the product at no cost to you within a reasonable time, without significant inconvenience.

Replacement: If repair is impractical or the defect is significant, you may request a replacement with a new, non-defective item.

Price Reduction: You may request a proportionate reduction in price if you are willing to keep the item despite the defect.

Refund (Contract Rescission): If the defect is significant and neither repair nor replacement is feasible within a reasonable time, you have the right to return the product and get a full refund of the price paid. (Note: For minor defects, a refund option may not be available, only repair or replacement.)
We will honor your chosen remedy unless it is impossible or would impose disproportionate costs on us compared to an alternative remedy. In such a case, we may offer an alternative solution (for example, we might offer a replacement instead of a refund, if the latter is disproportionately costly).

Return Shipping for Complaints: If you are asked to return a defective product to us for inspection or repair, we will cover the return shipping cost or provide a prepaid shipping label. Alternatively, we may arrange a pickup of the item at our expense.

Fresh/Food Products: In case of food products or other items that can spoil, it’s important that you check them upon delivery. If you find that a food item is spoiled or past its expiration date upon arrival, please notify us immediately (preferably within 1–2 days of delivery). We will typically offer a replacement or refund for spoiled or damaged food products.

Manufacturer’s Guarantee: Some products might come with a manufacturer’s warranty or guarantee. Such a guarantee is an additional service and does not affect your legal rights. If applicable, warranty documents will be provided with the product or indicated in the product description.

Liability: We are liable for defects in products under the conditions set forth by Polish law (Articles 556–576 of the Civil Code). In summary, defects that manifest within two years from delivery (or one year for used items) are presumed to have existed at the time of delivery, unless such presumption is incompatible with the nature of the item or defect. Our liability under this statutory warranty is limited to 2 years from delivery (for consumers).

Out-of-court Dispute Resolution: We aim to resolve complaints amicably. If you are not satisfied with our handling of a complaint, you can use alternative dispute resolution. For instance, you may contact the municipal consumer ombudsman or utilize the Online Dispute Resolution (ODR) platform at ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr. These options are available to help consumers resolve disputes without going to court.

Limitation of Liability:

For Service Availability: While we strive to keep the App up and running smoothly, the Seller does not guarantee continuous, uninterrupted access to the App. We shall not be held responsible for any delay or failure in performance caused by factors beyond our reasonable control (force majeure, internet outages, etc.).

For Information Accuracy: We make every effort to ensure that product descriptions, images, and prices in the App are accurate and up to date. However, in case of any errors or discrepancies, we reserve the right to correct them. If such a correction affects your existing order, we will contact you to confirm whether you still wish to proceed.

For Fit and Allergens: We shall not be liable for any allergic reactions or health issues arising from the consumption or use of Products sold, provided that we accurately conveyed the ingredient information and the Products were delivered in the condition expected. Users are responsible for reading product descriptions and labels (including allergen information) and using the products in accordance with their intended use.

User Conduct: The User is expected to use the App in accordance with the law and good practices. The User must not introduce any malicious code (viruses, worms) or engage in activities that could harm the App’s functionality or other Users. Any attempt to compromise the security or integrity of the App is strictly prohibited and may result in termination of access and legal action.

Indirect Damages: To the extent permitted by law, the Seller is not liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages (such as loss of profits, loss of data, or costs of substitute goods or services) arising out of or related to the use of the App or products purchased, except in cases of willful misconduct or gross negligence. This does not limit any liability that cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law.

Amendments to Terms:

The Seller may amend these Terms for valid reasons, such as changes in law, changes in our business processes, or improvements in App functionality. When we update the Terms, we will notify Users in advance by posting a notice in the App or via email (for registered account holders) at least 7 days before the new Terms become effective.

The notice of changes will clearly indicate the effective date of the updated Terms and will summarize the key modifications. During the notice period, the updated Terms will be available for review in the App.

If a User does not agree with the new Terms, they have the right to stop using the App and (if applicable) delete their Account before the effective date. Continued use of the App after the effective date constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.

For any orders placed before the effective date of a change, the Terms in effect at the time of order placement will apply to that order, unless the changes were required by law (in which case the legally required provisions will also apply to prior orders).

Final Provisions:

Governing Law: These Terms and any contracts for sale concluded through the App are governed by the laws of Poland. This choice of law does not deprive consumers of the protection afforded to them by provisions that cannot be derogated from by agreement under the law of the country of their residence (if the consumer is resident in another EU country, they may have additional protections under local law).

Consumer Rights: Nothing in these Terms is intended to limit the statutory rights of consumers. In the event of any conflict between these Terms and the mandatory provisions of law, the provisions of law shall prevail.

Language: The App and the sales contract are offered in Polish and English. These Terms are available in both Polish and English. The English version is provided for convenience and informational purposes. In case of any discrepancies or interpretations, the Polish version shall take precedence as the legally binding text
