Terms of Service

General Provisions:

These Terms of Service (hereinafter "Terms") govern the use of the "Metropolitan" mobile application and website (the "Platform") provided by Metropolitan Food Group sp. z o.o., a limited liability company based in Warsaw, Poland (registered address: ul. Aleja Krakowska 44, 05-090 Janki, Warsaw, Poland). Metropolitan Food Group sp. z o.o. is registered in the National Court Register (KRS) under number 0000317933, NIP (tax ID) 7292645203, with share capital of 173,000 PLN. The company, referred to as the "Seller", sells food products to consumers in Poland via this Platform.

These Terms are made available to all Users free of charge via the Platform (and on the website www.metropolitanfg.pl, if applicable) in a form that allows them to be downloaded, saved, and printed. This document constitutes the regulations for the provision of electronic services as required by Article 8 of the Polish Act of 18 July 2002 on Providing Services by Electronic Means.

By installing or using the Platform, including registering an account or placing an order, the person using the Platform (the “User”) agrees to abide by these Terms. If you do not agree with any part of the Terms, please refrain from using the Platform.

To use the Platform, the User must have a compatible mobile device with Internet access and a current operating system. The App is free to download and use; however, the User is responsible for any data charges incurred (per the User’s mobile network plan) and for paying the price of any products purchased through the Platform.

Definitions:

Seller – Metropolitan Food Group sp. z o.o., ul. Aleja Krakowska 44, 05-090 Janki, Warsaw, Poland, KRS 0000317933, NIP 7292645203. In these Terms, the Seller is also referred to as “we” or “us”. The Seller is the provider of the Platform and the party that sells Products to Users.

User – any natural person who has full legal capacity and uses the Platform to browse and purchase Products as a consumer (for purposes unrelated to their trade, business, or profession). If a person is under 18 years old or otherwise does not have full legal capacity (e.g., minors over 13 with limited capacity), they may use the Platform and make purchases only with the consent and supervision of a parent or legal guardian.

Products – tangible goods available for sale through the Platform, primarily food products and groceries. Each Product is described in the Platform with details such as name, price, ingredients (if applicable), and other relevant information.

Product Information Display (Food Labeling Compliance): In accordance with Polish food labeling regulations and the Food and Nutrition Safety Act, we display the following mandatory information for each food product on our Platform:
- Complete list of ingredients (including substances causing allergies or intolerances)
- Nutritional declaration (energy value, fats, saturated fats, carbohydrates, sugars, protein, salt)
- Net quantity of the product
- Date of minimum durability or 'use by' date
- Storage conditions and conditions of use
- Name and address of the food business operator
- Country of origin or place of provenance where required
All product information is displayed in Polish as required by law. This information is available on the product page before purchase.

Order – an instruction submitted by the User via the Platform’s ordering interface, indicating the User’s intent to purchase selected Products from the Seller under the conditions specified at checkout and in these Terms. An Order includes details like the chosen items and quantities, delivery address, and payment method.

Account – a personal user account within the Platform, created upon registration, which stores the User’s profile information (name, contact details, etc.) and records of orders placed. The Account is protected by login credentials (email address and password).

Terms – this Terms of Service document, governing both the use of the Platform and the sales of Products via the Platform.

Account Registration:

Registration of an Account in the Platform is recommended for a better shopping experience and may be required to place orders. To register, the User must complete the sign-up form in the Platform, providing information such as name, email address, and a password. The User must ensure that the information provided is accurate and current.

Account creation is voluntary and free of charge. A single User should register only one Account. The Account is non-transferable.

The User is responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of their Account login credentials. The User should not share their password with anyone. Any activity conducted through the Account will be presumed to be authorized by the User. If the User suspects any unauthorized use of their Account, they should notify the Seller immediately so that appropriate measures can be taken (e.g., password reset or account suspension).

The User can delete their Account at any time by contacting the Seller (for example, via email) or using any account deletion function provided within the Platform. Deleting the Account will result in termination of the contract for electronic services related to the Account (subject to data retention required for legal compliance as described in the Privacy Policy). The User’s right to use the Platform (as a guest or by creating a new account later) remains unaffected by deleting an Account.

Placing Orders:

Through the Platform, the Seller enables Users to place orders for available Products at any time (24 hours a day, 7 days a week). Orders placed outside of normal working hours will be processed on the next business day.

To place an Order, the User selects a Product and adds it to the virtual shopping cart. The User can adjust quantities or remove items from the cart before proceeding. When ready, the User proceeds to checkout, where the Platform will prompt for necessary information: delivery details (recipient name, address, phone number), email address (for order confirmation and communication), and payment method. If the User requires an invoice for a business purchase, they should provide the company name, registered address, and tax ID during checkout.

Before final submission, the User is presented with an order summary detailing the Products to be purchased, their individual prices, any applicable taxes, delivery cost, and the total amount payable. The User should carefully review this information and correct any errors (e.g., in the delivery address or product quantities) before confirming the Order.

To finalize the Order, the User must confirm the summary and select the option to place the order with an obligation to pay (the wording may be a button like “Order and Pay”). By doing so, the User makes a binding offer to buy the Products listed in the order summary, under the conditions stated in these Terms.

Upon receiving an Order, the Seller will acknowledge it by sending an order confirmation to the User (typically via email, and/or an in-app notification). This confirmation will summarize the Order details and assign an order number. The moment the User receives the confirmation (or, at latest, when we commence fulfillment of the order) a sales contract is formed between the User and the Seller for the Products specified.

If for any reason we are unable to accept or fulfill an Order (for example, if a Product is out of stock or if the provided delivery address is outside our service area), we will inform the User as soon as possible. If payment was already made for such an Order (or part of it), the User will be refunded for the unavailable items. Partial fulfillment (shipping available items and refunding the rest) may occur with the User’s consent; otherwise, the Order may be cancelled in full with a full refund.

The Seller reserves the right to verify Orders in cases of doubt (for instance, unusually large orders or potential errors). We may contact the User via email or phone to confirm order details or to clarify information before processing.

Omnibus Directive Compliance:

In accordance with EU Directive 2019/2161 (Omnibus Directive), we provide the following transparency measures:

Price Transparency:
- Previous Price Display: When we display a reduced price, we show the lowest price from the previous 30 days before the reduction
- Clear indication of any personalized pricing based on automated decision-making
- All prices include VAT and any applicable fees upfront

Product Reviews and Ratings:
- All reviews are verified to come from actual purchasers
- We display the verification status of each review
- Moderation process to prevent fake or misleading content
- Clear disclosure if reviews are incentivized or sponsored

Consumer Information Rights:
- Clear identification of Metropolitan Food Group as the seller
- Disclosure when products come from third-party suppliers
- Indication whether third-party sellers are traders or private individuals
- Clear information about consumer protection that applies to each transaction

Ranking and Search Results:
- Products are displayed based on relevance, price, availability, and user preferences
- Any paid placements or promotions are clearly marked
- No hidden algorithms that unfairly disadvantage certain products

Penalties for Non-Compliance:
We acknowledge that violations of consumer protection laws may result in penalties up to 4% of annual turnover. We maintain strict compliance procedures to ensure all requirements are met.

Prices and Payment:

Product Prices: All prices displayed in the Platform are in Polish Złoty (PLN) and are gross prices including VAT. The price shown for a Product at the time of Order placement is the price that will be charged. If a price was obviously misstated due to an error and was significantly low or high, the Seller will contact the User to inform about the mistake and may cancel the Order if the User does not agree to the correct price.

Payment Timing: Unless otherwise agreed, all Orders must be paid for at the time of ordering (prepayment). We do not offer “cash on delivery” or post-payment by default. Ownership of the goods will transfer to the User only after full payment of the purchase price.

Payment Methods: The following forms of payment are accepted for purchases made via the Platform:

Online payment by credit/debit card or quick bank transfer – these are processed through the Stripe payment system. When this method is selected, the User will securely submit payment details through Stripe’s interface integrated in our App. Stripe Payments Europe (Stripe’s EU affiliate) is the entity processing the payment in the EU
The User must follow the on-screen instructions to complete the payment. Upon successful payment, the Order will move to processing.
(If we support other payment methods, such as mobile payments or bank transfer, they would be listed here with instructions.)
Note: The Seller does not collect or store sensitive payment data like full card numbers or bank credentials; such information is handled by Stripe on secure servers.

Payment Issues: If the payment fails or is not completed (e.g., due to card authorization failure or technical issues), the Order will not be accepted or processed. The User may attempt to place the Order again using a different payment method. The Seller is not liable for delays in processing or non-fulfillment of an Order if the failure to pay is due to the User’s action or omission or issues on the side of the payment provider.

Invoices: For each completed purchase, the Seller will issue either a fiscal receipt or a VAT invoice. By default, consumers receive a receipt. If the User needs an invoice (e.g., for a business purchase or personal records), they should provide the necessary billing details at the time of Order (company name, address, VAT ID if applicable). The invoice may be sent electronically to the User’s email address, unless a paper invoice is requested.

All payments are handled in compliance with data security standards. Our payment processor (Stripe) is PCI-DSS compliant, and all communication is encrypted. In case of any overcharge or duplicate charge, please contact us for prompt resolution.

Delivery:

Geographic Scope: The Seller currently ships Products only within Poland. Orders with delivery addresses outside Poland cannot be processed.

Delivery Address: Products will be delivered to the address specified by the User when placing the Order. It is the User’s responsibility to provide a correct, complete, and reachable address. We are not liable for delays or non-delivery if the address provided was incorrect or incomplete.

Delivery Methods and Costs: Available delivery methods (courier, postal service, parcel locker, etc.) and the associated shipping fees are presented to the User at checkout. The delivery cost depends on factors such as order size, weight, and selected carrier. Any applicable shipping promotions (e.g., free delivery for orders over a certain amount) will be automatically applied according to current terms.

Delivery Time: We aim to dispatch orders promptly. The estimated delivery time within Poland is usually 2–5 business days from the date of order confirmation. Please note that this is an estimate and not a guaranteed delivery window. During high-demand periods (like holidays or promotions) or due to unforeseen circumstances (e.g., weather events, courier delays), delivery might take longer. We will inform you if we become aware of any significant delay.

Order Tracking: Whenever possible, we will provide a tracking number or link so that the User can monitor the shipment status. This information will typically be sent in the shipping confirmation email or made available in the User’s Account under order details.

Receipt of Goods: Upon delivery, the User (or an authorized recipient at the address) should inspect the package for any visible damage. If the package appears damaged or tampered with, the User should, if possible, note this with the courier (e.g., by filling a damage report) and contact us promptly. While we ensure proper packaging, any damage in transit will be handled in accordance with the complaints procedure (see Complaints section below).

Failed Delivery: If a package cannot be delivered due to the User’s absence or other reason and is returned to us, we will contact the User to arrange a re-delivery. Additional delivery charges may apply for the second attempt, unless the failure was due to our or the carrier’s fault. If we cannot reach the User for re-delivery arrangements or the User declines re-delivery, we may treat the contract as terminated and process a refund for the order minus reasonable costs of delivery and return.

Right of Withdrawal (Consumer Returns):
The provisions in this section apply only if you are a consumer (an individual making a purchase for personal use, not related to business activities) and only to the extent not excluded by law (see exceptions below).

14-Day Return Period: As a consumer, you have the right to withdraw from the sales contract without giving any reason within 14 days after you or a person you designate (other than the carrier) receives the Product. If your order consisted of multiple items delivered separately, the 14-day period starts from receipt of the last item.

How to Withdraw: To exercise the right of withdrawal, you must inform us of your decision before the 14-day period has expired. You may do this by sending a clear statement (e.g., an email or a letter sent by post) to our contact address provided in these Terms. You may use the model withdrawal form that we can provide, but it is not obligatory. For your convenience, you can simply state your name, order number, and your intention to withdraw from the contract.

Effects of Withdrawal: If you withdraw from the contract, we will treat the purchase as canceled. We will refund all payments we received from you for the returned product, including the cost of the cheapest standard delivery offered for your order (if a delivery fee was charged). The refund will be made without undue delay, and in any event no later than 14 days from the day we receive your withdrawal notice. However, we may withhold reimbursement until we have received the returned product back or you have supplied evidence of having sent back the product, whichever occurs first.

Refund Method: We will refund you using the same payment method you used for the initial transaction, unless you explicitly agree to a different method that does not incur any fees for you. For example, if you paid by card, we will refund to the same card; if you paid via bank transfer, we will ask for your bank details for the refund.

Return of Goods: You are expected to send back or hand over the product(s) to us no later than 14 days from the day on which you communicate your withdrawal. You will bear the direct cost of returning the goods (shipping costs for the return) unless we have agreed otherwise. We recommend that you pack the item securely and, if possible, use the original packaging. Please include either a copy of the receipt or a note with your order number to help us identify the return.

Condition of Returned Goods: You should handle the products you ordered with care. You are allowed to inspect the nature, characteristics, and functioning of the item as you would in a physical store, but if you use the product beyond that (e.g., actually using food items or consuming part of them), and as a result the product’s value is diminished, we may deduct compensation for the loss in value from your refund.

Exceptions (No Right of Withdrawal): Certain products are not eligible for the 14-day return right, by law. The right of withdrawal does not apply to, among others:

Goods that are liable to deteriorate or expire rapidly (e.g., fresh food products, items with a short shelf life).

Sealed goods which are not suitable for return due to health protection or hygiene reasons, if unsealed after delivery (this includes all sealed packaged food products that cannot be resold once the seal is broken for hygiene and food safety reasons).

Goods made to your specifications or clearly personalized.

Sealed audio or video recordings or computer software which were unsealed after delivery.

Newspapers, periodicals or magazines (except for subscription contracts).
If a product you purchased falls under these exceptions, we will have informed you of this in the product description or at checkout, and you agree that no return can be accepted for those particular items.

Return Address: Unless we provide a different return address when you contact us, you should send returned products to our company’s registered address (see Contact Information below). We advise using a tracked shipping method and keeping proof of return shipment.

Customer Support: If you have any questions about the return process, you can contact us at our customer service email or phone number for assistance.

Complaints and Warranty:

Statutory Warranty: We are obliged to deliver products that conform to the contract of sale. This means the products should match their description, be of satisfactory quality, and be fit for normal use. If a product you purchased is defective (e.g., it is damaged, spoiled, or does not match its description or intended use), you have the right to file a complaint. This right is based on the statutory warranty for defects (in Polish law: rękojmia).

How to File a Complaint: You should inform us if you find any issues with the product. You can send a complaint via email or letter. Please include your name, order number, the product in question, and a description of the problem. If possible, attach photos if it’s a physical defect or damage, as this can help us resolve the issue more quickly.

Timeline: We will acknowledge and respond to your complaint within 14 days of receiving it. If we do not respond within this 14-day period, the law deems that we have accepted the complaint and acknowledge the defect.

Resolution: Depending on the nature of the defect and your request, the possible resolutions under warranty are:

Repair: If the item can be fixed, you may request a repair. We will repair the product at no cost to you within a reasonable time, without significant inconvenience.

Replacement: If repair is impractical or the defect is significant, you may request a replacement with a new, non-defective item.

Price Reduction: You may request a proportionate reduction in price if you are willing to keep the item despite the defect.

Refund (Contract Rescission): If the defect is significant and neither repair nor replacement is feasible within a reasonable time, you have the right to return the product and get a full refund of the price paid. (Note: For minor defects, a refund option may not be available, only repair or replacement.)
We will honor your chosen remedy unless it is impossible or would impose disproportionate costs on us compared to an alternative remedy. In such a case, we may offer an alternative solution (for example, we might offer a replacement instead of a refund, if the latter is disproportionately costly).

Return Shipping for Complaints: If you are asked to return a defective product to us for inspection or repair, we will cover the return shipping cost or provide a prepaid shipping label. Alternatively, we may arrange a pickup of the item at our expense.

Fresh/Food Products: In case of food products or other items that can spoil, it’s important that you check them upon delivery. If you find that a food item is spoiled or past its expiration date upon arrival, please notify us immediately (preferably within 1–2 days of delivery). We will typically offer a replacement or refund for spoiled or damaged food products.

Manufacturer’s Guarantee: Some products might come with a manufacturer’s warranty or guarantee. Such a guarantee is an additional service and does not affect your legal rights. If applicable, warranty documents will be provided with the product or indicated in the product description.

Liability: We are liable for defects in products under the conditions set forth by Polish law (Articles 556–576 of the Civil Code). In summary, defects that manifest within two years from delivery (or one year for used items) are presumed to have existed at the time of delivery, unless such presumption is incompatible with the nature of the item or defect. Our liability under this statutory warranty is limited to 2 years from delivery (for consumers).

Out-of-court Dispute Resolution: We aim to resolve complaints amicably. If you are not satisfied with our handling of a complaint, you can use alternative dispute resolution. For instance, you may contact the municipal consumer ombudsman or utilize the Online Dispute Resolution (ODR) platform at ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr. These options are available to help consumers resolve disputes without going to court.

Limitation of Liability:

For Service Availability: While we strive to keep the Platform up and running smoothly, the Seller does not guarantee continuous, uninterrupted access to the Platform. We shall not be held responsible for any delay or failure in performance caused by factors beyond our reasonable control (force majeure, internet outages, etc.).

For Information Accuracy: We make every effort to ensure that product descriptions, images, and prices in the Platform are accurate and up to date. However, in case of any errors or discrepancies, we reserve the right to correct them. If such a correction affects your existing order, we will contact you to confirm whether you still wish to proceed.

For Fit and Allergens: We shall not be liable for any allergic reactions or health issues arising from the consumption or use of Products sold, provided that we accurately conveyed the ingredient information and the Products were delivered in the condition expected. Users are responsible for reading product descriptions and labels (including allergen information) and using the products in accordance with their intended use.

User Conduct: The User is expected to use the Platform in accordance with the law and good practices. The User must not introduce any malicious code (viruses, worms) or engage in activities that could harm the Platform’s functionality or other Users. Any attempt to compromise the security or integrity of the Platform is strictly prohibited and may result in termination of access and legal action.

Indirect Damages: To the extent permitted by law, the Seller is not liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages (such as loss of profits, loss of data, or costs of substitute goods or services) arising out of or related to the use of the Platform or products purchased, except in cases of willful misconduct or gross negligence. This does not limit any liability that cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law.

Amendments to Terms:

The Seller may amend these Terms for valid reasons, such as changes in law, changes in our business processes, or improvements in App functionality. When we update the Terms, we will notify Users in advance by posting a notice in the Platform or via email (for registered account holders) at least 7 days before the new Terms become effective.

The notice of changes will clearly indicate the effective date of the updated Terms and will summarize the key modifications. During the notice period, the updated Terms will be available for review in the Platform.

If a User does not agree with the new Terms, they have the right to stop using the Platform and (if applicable) delete their Account before the effective date. Continued use of the Platform after the effective date constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.

For any orders placed before the effective date of a change, the Terms in effect at the time of order placement will apply to that order, unless the changes were required by law (in which case the legally required provisions will also apply to prior orders).

Final Provisions:

Governing Law: These Terms and any contracts for sale concluded through the Platform are governed by the laws of Poland. This choice of law does not deprive consumers of the protection afforded to them by provisions that cannot be derogated from by agreement under the law of the country of their residence (if the consumer is resident in another EU country, they may have additional protections under local law).

Consumer Rights: Nothing in these Terms is intended to limit the statutory rights of consumers. In the event of any conflict between these Terms and the mandatory provisions of law, the provisions of law shall prevail.

Language: The Platform and the sales contract are offered in Polish, English, and Turkish. These Terms are available in Polish, English, and Turkish. All product descriptions must be available in Polish as required by Polish law. In case of any discrepancies or interpretations, the Polish version shall take precedence as the legally binding text.

Severability: If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable by a competent authority or court, that provision will be severed and the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect. The invalid provision shall be interpreted or replaced in a way that closely reflects the original intent and economic effect.

Contact Information: For support, questions, or complaints, Users may contact the Seller at: Metropolitan Food Group sp. z o.o., ul. Aleja Krakowska 44, 05-090 Janki, Warsaw, Poland, Email: info@metropolitanfg.pl, Phone: [phone number]. We strive to respond to all inquiries in a timely manner.

Effective Date: These Terms of Service are effective as of September 23, 2025 and apply to all use of the Platform and orders placed on or after this date. Any previous terms of service for the Metropolitan Platform are superseded by this version.
