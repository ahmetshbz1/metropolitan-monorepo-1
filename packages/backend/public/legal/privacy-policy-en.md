Privacy Policy

Data Controller: The controller of your personal data is Metropolitan Food Group sp. z o.o., registered in Poland at ul. Aleja Krakowska 44, 05-090 Janki, Warsaw. This is a limited liability company listed in the National Court Register (KRS) under number 0000317933, with tax ID (NIP) 7292645203
. We are committed to protecting your privacy in compliance with applicable laws, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

Scope of this Policy: This Privacy Policy applies to the "Metropolitan" mobile application and website, which facilitates the sale of food products in Poland. It explains what personal data we collect through our platform, for what purposes we use it, and with whom we may share it. By using our platform, you acknowledge and agree to the practices described below.

Types of Data Collected:

Legal Basis Disclosure: We collect different types of personal data based on various legal grounds under GDPR. Below, we clearly indicate the legal basis for each category of data collection and whether it is mandatory or optional.

Information You Provide:

Mandatory Data (Legal Basis: Contract Performance - Article 6(1)(b) GDPR):
- Full name - required for order processing and delivery
- Delivery address - required for product shipment
- Email address - required for order confirmation and essential communications
- Phone number - required for delivery coordination
- Payment information - required for transaction processing

Optional Data for Business Customers (Legal Basis: Legal Obligation - Article 6(1)(c) GDPR):
- NIP (Tax ID) - required only for VAT invoices and B2B transactions
- Company name and address - required for business invoicing

Optional Data (Legal Basis: Consent - Article 6(1)(a) GDPR):
- Marketing preferences - for promotional emails and SMS (separate explicit consent required)
- Newsletter subscription - for updates about new products and offers
- Personalized recommendations - based on your shopping history

Providing mandatory information is necessary to enter into a sales contract and fulfill your order. Optional data enhances your experience but is not required for basic service.

Order and Transaction Data: Details of the orders you place (e.g. list of purchased items, order date and number, chosen payment method, transaction amount) and your purchase history. We use this data to fulfill your orders and maintain proper records for accounting and customer service.

Technical and Usage Data: We may collect certain technical information automatically when you use our platform, including your device’s IP address, device and browser type, language settings, and usage data (such as features used and pages viewed within our platform). In particular, our integrated Stripe payment system may track device and browser details (like IP address and language preferences) and user activity via Stripe’s SDK in order to help detect fraud and ensure transaction security. This information helps us improve the platform's performance, security, and user experience.

Payment Information: If you make a payment through Stripe on our platform, the data necessary to process the payment (such as the cardholder’s name, email, billing address, payment amount and method) will be transmitted to Stripe and processed by them. Note: We do not collect or store your full credit card details ourselves – payment transactions are handled securely by the external payment processor (Stripe).

Customer Support Communications: If you contact us with an inquiry or support request (via email or through our platform), we may keep a record of that correspondence and any contact information you provided, so that we can respond to you and improve our services.

Purposes and Legal Bases for Processing:
We process personal data collected from you only for specific purposes and only where we have a legal basis under GDPR to do so. These purposes and bases include:

Order Fulfillment and Contract: To process and fulfill your orders for products, arrange delivery, and facilitate payments. This is necessary for the performance of the sales contract between you and us (GDPR Article 6(1)(b)).

Billing and Legal Compliance: To issue purchase receipts or VAT invoices and to comply with our legal obligations related to accounting, taxation, and consumer protection. The legal basis for such processing is our compliance with a legal obligation (GDPR Article 6(1)(c)). For example, we may use an invoicing service (Fakturownia) to generate and store invoices containing your name, address, and tax ID, as required by law. Fakturownia processes customer data solely as a data processor on our behalf, under a data processing agreement and in compliance with GDPR.

Payment Processing: To enable you to pay for orders electronically via our payment provider (Stripe). For this purpose, we transmit the necessary payment details to Stripe to authorize and complete the transaction. The legal basis for sharing data with Stripe is that it is necessary to perform the contract (Article 6(1)(b)) and our legitimate interest in providing a secure and efficient payment solution (Article 6(1)(f)). Stripe may also use the data for fraud prevention and to fulfill its own legal obligations (e.g. anti-money laundering regulations).

Product Delivery: To deliver your purchased products to your specified address, we work with external courier/delivery services. We will use and share your contact information and address for the purpose of delivering the goods (performance of the contract, Article 6(1)(b)).

Customer Service and Communications: To communicate with you about your orders (e.g. order confirmations, updates, delivery notifications), respond to your inquiries, and handle complaints or returns. Depending on the context, the legal basis is either contract necessity (for communications about fulfilling an order) or our legitimate interest in ensuring quality customer service and support (Article 6(1)(f)).

Direct Marketing (with consent): Marketing communications require your explicit, freely given consent (Article 6(1)(a) GDPR). We will never send promotional emails or SMS without your clear agreement. Pre-ticked boxes are not used. You can withdraw consent at any time through:
- Unsubscribe link in every marketing email
- Your account settings
- Contacting us at info@metropolitanfg.pl

Withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing prior to withdrawal. Please note that transactional emails (order confirmations, delivery updates) are sent based on contract performance and do not require separate consent.

Analytics and Improvements (legitimate interest): We may use technical and usage data to analyze how the platform is used, to troubleshoot performance issues, and to develop new features or improve existing ones. We rely on our legitimate interest in analyzing and improving our services (Article 6(1)(f) GDPR) – in doing so, we typically use aggregated or anonymized data that does not identify individual users.

Sharing of Data with Third Parties:
We treat your personal data as confidential and do not sell it to third parties. However, we do share data with certain trusted third parties when it is necessary to achieve the purposes described above, or when we are legally required to do so. The main categories of recipients include:

Payment Processor (Stripe): When you make an online payment on the platform, the payment details are forwarded to Stripe. Stripe processes these data as an independent data controller for the purpose of completing the payment, under its own privacy policy. Stripe is a global company; therefore, your payment data may be processed on servers outside the European Economic Area (for example, in the USA). Stripe has safeguards in place for international data transfers, including participation in the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework. We hereby inform you (as required by Stripe’s policies) that we share your personal data with Stripe for payment processing.

Invoicing Service (Fakturownia): If we issue an invoice for your order, we will input the necessary personal data (name, address, tax ID if applicable) into the Fakturownia invoicing system, operated by Fakturownia sp. z o.o. Fakturownia acts as our data processor and uses the data only to properly issue, send and archive the sales documents, according to our agreement with them and GDPR requirements.

Delivery Companies: For order fulfillment, we share your delivery address and contact phone number with the courier or postal service responsible for delivering your package. They are authorized to use this information only for delivery purposes.

IT/Hosting Providers: We use reputable third-party providers for application hosting, data storage (cloud services), and related IT support. These providers may incidentally have access to personal data in the course of maintenance or backup operations, but they process data only on our instruction (as processors) and are bound by strict confidentiality and data protection obligations.

Legal Authorities: We will disclose personal data to government or law enforcement authorities if required to do so by law – for example, in response to a court order, subpoena, or other legal process, or to meet statutory reporting obligations.

All third parties that process personal data on our behalf are bound by data processing agreements and must implement appropriate data protection and security measures. They can only use your data within the scope of the purposes we specify. We do not permit any third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own marketing purposes.

Data Retention:
We retain personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, or to comply with applicable legal requirements. Specifically:

Account Data: If you have an account, your profile information is stored as long as your account is active. If you delete your account, we will remove or anonymize your personal data from our active systems (unless we need to retain certain information to comply with laws or resolve disputes). Backup copies might persist temporarily but will be purged according to our data retention cycle.

Order and Transaction Data: Records of purchases, invoices, and payments are retained for the period required by law. In Poland, financial records (e.g. invoices) must be kept for 5 years for tax and accounting purposes.

Marketing Data: If we process personal data based on your consent (e.g. email address for newsletter), we keep it until you withdraw consent. If you unsubscribe from marketing communications, we will stop using your data for that purpose and remove it from our marketing list.

Logs and Analytics: Technical logs and usage data are generally retained for troubleshooting and analytics for up to 12 months in an identifiable form. Aggregated, anonymized analytics (which contain no personal data) may be kept longer for historical analysis.

After the applicable retention period, we will securely erase or irreversibly anonymize personal data. In some cases, data may persist in secure backups for a short additional period, but we will not use it for any active purpose after the retention period expires.

Your Rights:
Under GDPR and relevant data protection laws, you have a number of rights regarding your personal data. These include:

Right to Access: You have the right to ask us whether we are processing your personal data, and if so, to receive a copy of the data along with information about how we use it.

Right to Rectification: You can request that we correct any inaccurate or incomplete personal data about you. We encourage you to keep your account information up-to-date.

Right to Erasure: You can, in certain circumstances, request that we delete your personal data (for example, if it is no longer needed for the purposes it was collected, or if you withdraw consent and we have no other legal basis for processing). This is not an absolute right – for instance, we might need to retain some data to comply with a legal obligation.

Right to Restrict Processing: You can ask us to restrict (pause) the processing of your personal data in certain cases – for example, while we are verifying the accuracy of your data or when you have objected to our processing and we are considering whether our legitimate grounds override yours.

Right to Data Portability: For data that you have provided to us and which we process by automated means under consent or contract, you have the right to request a copy in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. You also have the right to request that we transfer this data to another controller, where technically feasible.

Right to Object: You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data when we process it based on legitimate interests, on grounds relating to your particular situation. If you object, we will consider whether our compelling legitimate grounds for processing override your interests, rights, and freedoms. Note: If your data is processed for direct marketing purposes, you have the right to object at any time and we will stop processing for that purpose immediately.

Right to Withdraw Consent: If we rely on your consent for any processing of personal data, you can withdraw that consent at any time. This will not affect the lawfulness of processing that happened prior to withdrawal, but it will mean we can no longer process the data in question going forward.

Right to Lodge a Complaint: If you believe we have infringed your data protection rights, you have the right to file a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the EU country of your habitual residence or where the alleged infringement occurred. In Poland, the supervisory authority is the President of the Personal Data Protection Office (Prezes UODO).

You may exercise your rights by contacting us using the contact information provided below. We will respond as soon as possible, and no later than one month after receiving your request (this period may be extended by two further months if necessary, depending on the complexity and number of requests, but we will inform you if an extension is needed).

Automated Decision-Making and AI:
We may use automated systems for:
- Fraud prevention in payment processing
- Product recommendations based on purchase history
- Inventory management and pricing

You have the right to request human review of any automated decision that significantly affects you. We ensure transparency in our AI systems as required by the EU AI Act.

Data Security:
We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational measures to secure your personal data and protect it against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. For example, all network communications involving personal data (including payment information) are encrypted using SSL/TLS protocols. We restrict access to personal data to authorized personnel and contractors who need that data to operate, develop, or improve our services, and these individuals are subject to confidentiality obligations. We also maintain procedures to handle any suspected data breaches, and in the unlikely event of a data breach affecting your personal information, we will notify you and the relevant authorities as required by law.

In accordance with UODO's 2025 enforcement priorities, we maintain comprehensive documentation of all personal data breaches, including:

- Measures implemented to prevent future occurrences
Even breaches not requiring notification to authorities are documented internally for compliance purposes. This documentation is available for inspection by UODO upon request.

Processor Due Diligence:
Following UODO's enhanced enforcement standards from recent cases, we conduct thorough due diligence on all data processors, including:
- Regular audits of security measures
