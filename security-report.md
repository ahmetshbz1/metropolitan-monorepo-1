# Security Audit Report

## Executive Summary

The Metropolitan monorepo has been thoroughly audited for security vulnerabilities across both backend (Elysia.js + Bun) and mobile app (React Native + Expo) components. While the codebase demonstrates good security practices in several areas, multiple critical and high-severity vulnerabilities have been identified that require immediate attention.

**Risk Assessment**: The application currently has a **HIGH** overall security risk due to missing security headers, lack of rate limiting, potential SQL injection vectors, and insufficient input validation in certain areas.

## Critical Vulnerabilities

### Missing Security Headers and CORS Configuration

- **Location**: `packages/backend/index.ts` and `packages/backend/src/shared/infrastructure/web/app.ts`
- **Description**: The backend API lacks essential security headers (CORS, CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.) and CORS configuration, making it vulnerable to cross-origin attacks
- **Impact**: Potential for XSS attacks, clickjacking, and unauthorized cross-origin requests
- **Remediation Checklist**:
  - [ ] Install and configure `@elysiajs/cors` plugin
  - [ ] Add security headers middleware with proper CSP policy
  - [ ] Configure CORS with specific allowed origins
  - [ ] Add the following headers: X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, Strict-Transport-Security
- **References**: [OWASP Security Headers](https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-headers/)

### Hardcoded Development Bypass in OTP Service

- **Location**: `packages/backend/src/domains/identity/application/use-cases/otp.service.ts` (lines 11-12)
- **Description**: Hardcoded bypass OTP code "555555" is enabled in development mode, which could be accidentally deployed to production
- **Impact**: Complete authentication bypass if NODE_ENV is misconfigured in production
- **Remediation Checklist**:
  - [ ] Remove hardcoded bypass code entirely
  - [ ] Use environment variable for test OTP codes if needed
  - [ ] Add build-time check to ensure bypass code is not present in production builds
  - [ ] Implement proper test doubles for OTP service in testing
